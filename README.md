# UVA EB Challenge

This repository hosts the code for a unique giveaway for the attendees of a workshop. The project aims to provide a digital keepsake in the form of an NFT, created from an image drawn by one of the attendees. To ensure a seamless Web3 onboarding experience, we utilize the Account Abstraction feature, enabling users to participate without needing their own wallet or dealing with cryptocurrency.

## What is Account Abstraction?

Account Abstraction is a feature in blockchain technology that simplifies the interaction between users and the blockchain. It abstracts the complexities of wallet management and transaction fees, allowing users to interact with the blockchain through more familiar methods such as email addresses. This approach aims to enhance user experience and broaden the adoption of Web3 technologies by reducing barriers to entry.

### Key Benefits

- **Simplified Wallet Management**: Users donâ€™t need to create or manage their own wallets. The system can generate wallets based on email addresses.
- **Enhanced Security**: By abstracting the account management, it minimizes the risk of user errors and potential security issues.
- **Ease of Use**: Makes Web3 technology accessible to non-technical users, encouraging broader adoption.
